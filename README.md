# my-arch-setup
config scripts to set up my arch linux flavor

# Usage
Start with the instructions in **bootstrap.txt**. This will get you installed
and running in a command-line environment which is livable, but not very
correct or friendly. Next, make the changes in **etc-config-changes.txt**.

# TODO
Change etc-config-changes.txt to be a script
which performs the requested edits.
Add it to a scripts/ directory.
